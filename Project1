Idea 1 - Spotify:
    
    a. Our idea is to create a database based on Spotify. This idea is not new. We are borrowing an idea from an existing business.
    A typical business day would be consist of users signing up for Spotify and being able to stream music for low cost. 
    As a bussiness, we keep track of the hottest artists and their followers. The most popular songs
    and albums.
    
    b. List your 5 tables and for each provide details about what data will be stored in the tables.
    End-Users -> payment plans and usage 
    Name of Artist -> Fiirst name, Last name, unique ID, their custom playlists, total views, and total followers
    Song -> Song unique ID, Genre ID, Artist ID, song name, play count, Album ID
    Podcasts -> Artist ID, 
    Spotify's Playlists ->
    Radio -> 
    their usage statistics?
