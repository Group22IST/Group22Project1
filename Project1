Idea 1 - Spotify:
    
    a. Our idea is to create a database based on Spotify. This idea is not new. We are borrowing an idea from an existing business.
    A typical business day would be consist of users signing up for Spotify and being able to stream music for low cost. 
    As a bussiness, we keep track of the hottest artists and their followers. The most popular songs
    and albums.
    
    b. List your 5 tables and for each provide details about what data will be stored in the tables.
    End-Users -> payment plans and usage 
    Name of Artist -> custom ID, their custom playlists, total views, and total followers
    Podcasts -> 
    Spotify's Playlists ->
    Radio -> 
    their usage statistics? 
    
    c. Goal
    The goal of Spotify is to figure out the relationship between artist and user. This will track
    the correlation between the amount of hours a user typically spends on a particular artist
    
Idea 2 - Discord:

Idea 3 - Venmo:

    friends you have, 
    
    
    
    c.
