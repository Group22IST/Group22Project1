Final Idea: Uber

A. Our idea is to create a database based on Uber. Another competitor to Uber is Lyft, but Uber holds the largest market share. A typical business interaction includes the user and the driver interacting through software. Through software, the transaction data and trip data are stored. Users can receive the car data in real-time from the software as well. 

B. List your 5 tables and for each provide details about what will be stored in the tables.
a.Trip Data will store trip-related data using the trip ID entity as a primary key. The constraint on this will be that trip ID is always unique. The attributes for this table are distance, location, wait time, start time, end time, customer rating, and driver rating. Along with the foreign key unique attributes driver ID, customer ID, and transaction ID. This entity will typically have a many to one relationship.
b. Driver data will store driver-related data using the Driver ID entity as the primary key. The constraint on this will be that Driver ID is always unique. The attributes for this table are first name, last name, driver rating, car model details, and the total trips. The attribute license plate number can serve as a secondary key. This entity will have a one to many relationship with Trip ID and Transaction ID and a one-to-one relationship with customerID and License plate.
c. Customer data will store customer-related data using the CustomerID entity as the primary key. The constraint on this will be that customer ID is always unique. The attributes for this table are first name, last name, payment information and past tripIDs.
d. Car data will store car-related data using the carID entity as the primary key. The constraint on this will be that the carID is always unique. The attributes for this table are latitude, longitude, license plate, driverID, and uber type. This entity will have a many to one relationship with customerID, one to one relationship with DriverID and a one to many relationship with tripID.
e. Transaction data will store transaction-related data using transactionID as the primary key. The constraint on this will be that transactionID is always unique. The attributes for this table are payment type, amount, currency, flash pricing, customerID, tripID, carID, and driverID. This entity will have many to one relationship with driverID, CustomerID, carID, and a one to one relationship with tripID.

C. Goal
Our goal is to determine when Uber should adjust their flash pricing, depending on the demand for Ubers during certain times of the day, seasons, and the location. This will be done by using trip data, customer data, car data, and transaction data.
